              Qamcom is happy to invite you to a free brekfast seminar on the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) movement. Olof Kindgren, co-founder and Director of FOSSi Foundation and FPGA/Embedded Specialist at Qamcom Research and Technology, will give some background on FOSSi and the current status as well as diving in to the most promising projects such as RISC-V, FuseSoC and yosys.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seminar will be held on Thursday 13 October at 07.30 - 09.00 at Sloopen, Kista NOD, Borgafjordsgatan 12, Kista.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will be offering a light breakfast before the presentation. The seminar is free but registration is required. Welcome!

            While the Open Source software movement focuses on the software that runs on processors and other chips, and the open source hardware movement focuses on building devices that often contain these chips, the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) movement is about using Open Source code and tools to build the chips themselves that are at the heart of most electronic devices.
          <p>
            Things are rapidly changing around FOSSi, and the last few years has seen an explosion of new projects and technologies coming from industry, academia and hobbyists, and the boundaries between hardware and software are dissolving. This also means that there is an increasing number of software engineers entering the digital design domain, bringing best practices such as CI, modern languages and package dependency handling from the software world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite all the recent advances, the world of Open Source Silicon is still unknown to many people working with embedded systems. This presentation will give an overview of the events leading up to the current state of FOSSi. We will look at what lies ahead, both in regards of the challenges we see and by taking a quick dive into some of the most promising projects such as RISC-V, FuseSoC and yosys to see how and why they can be used instead of proprietary technologies.

              Olof Kindgren is a co-founded and serves as a director of the FOSSi Foundation, a vendor-independent organization with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystem. Olof has for the past six years been an active member of many different FOSSi projects, most notably the OpenRISC project and FuseSoC. He has also organized the orconf conference for the past five years, which has now grown to become the largest conference for everything around FOSSi.
            <p>
              Olof has been engaged in open source software since the 90’s, but shifted his focus to hardware after getting a MSc. EE. in digital electronics. He has been working as a consultant in FPGA, ASIC and embedded systems since 2008 and has spent the last three years as an FPGA/embedded specialist for Qamcom Research and Technology (QRT). QRT’s main focus areas are within wireless connectivity, autonomous drive and industrial IoT covering e.g. various kinds of communication, radar and automotive systems.
